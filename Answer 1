# After running the code snippet, this is found that receiver_1 will start first and when it is finished then receiver_2 will start.
# Thus it proves that django signals are executed Synchronously.

# Expected output:
# Receiver 1 started
# Receiver 1 finished
# Receiver 2 started
# Receiver 2 finished
